#### Question

A popular masseuse receives a sequence of back-to-back appointment requests and is debating which ones to accept. She needs a lS-minute break between appointments and therefore she cannot accept any adjacent requests. Given a sequence of back-to-back appointment requests (all multiples of 1 S minutes, none overlap, and none can be moved), find the optimal (highest total booked minutes) set the masseuse can honor. Return the number of minutes.

#### Example

- Input: {30, 15, 60, 75, 45, 15, 15, 45}
- Output: 180 minutes ({30, 60, 45, 45})
