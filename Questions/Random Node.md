### Question

You are implementing a binary tree class from scratch which, in addition to insert, find, and delete, has a method `getRandomNode()` which returns a random node from the tree. All nodes should be equally likely to be chosen. Design and implement an algorithm for `getRandomNode()`, and explain how you would implement the rest of the methods.
