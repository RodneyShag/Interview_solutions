#### Question

T1 and T2 are two very large binary trees, with T1 much bigger than T2. Create an
algorithm to determine if T2 is a subtree of T1.

A tree T2 is a subtree of T1 if there exists a node n in T1 such that the subtree of n is identical to T2.
That is, if you cut off the tree at node n, the two trees would be identical.
