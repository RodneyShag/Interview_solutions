### Question

You are given two strings, `pattern` and `value`. The `pattern` string consists of just the letters `a` and `b`, describing a pattern within a string. For example, the string `catcatgocatgo` matches the pattern `aabab` (where `cat` is `a` and `go` is `b`). It also matches patterns like `a`, `ab`, and `b`. Write a method to determine if `value` matches `pattern`.
