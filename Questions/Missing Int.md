### Question

Given an input file with four billion non-negative integers, provide an algorithm to generate an integer that is not contained in the file. Assume you have 1 GB of memory available for this task.

### Follow-up Question

What if you have only 10MB of memory? Assume that all the values are distinct and we now have no more than one billion non-negative integers.
