#### Question

Given an array of integers, write a method to find indices `m` and `n` such that if you sorted elements `m` through `n`, the entire array would be sorted. Minimize `n - m` (that is, find the smallest such sequence).

#### Example

- Input 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 7, 12, 6, 7, 16, 18, 19
- Output: (3, 9)
