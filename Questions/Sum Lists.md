### Question

You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1 's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.

### Example

- Input: (7 -> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2). That is, 617 + 295.
- Output 2 -> 1 -> 9. That is, 912.

### Follow-up Question

Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above problem.

### Example

- Input: (6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5). That is, 617 + 295.
- Output 9 -> 1 -> 2. That is, 912.
