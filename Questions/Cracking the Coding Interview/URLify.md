### Question

Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with __%20__: You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (where "true" length ignores the extra space at the end of the string) 

If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.

### Example

- Input: "Mr John Smith ", 13
- Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
