#### Question

You are given an array-like data structure `Listy` which lacks a size method. It does, however, have an `elementAt(i)` method that returns the element at index `i` in `0(1)` time. If `i` is beyond the bounds of the data structure, it returns `-1`. (For this reason, the data structure only supports positive integers.) Given a `Listy` which contains sorted, positive integers, find the index at which an element `x` occurs. If `x` occurs multiple times, you may return any index.
