#### Question

There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.

#### Example

- pale, ple -> true
- pales. pale -> true
- pale. bale -> true
- pale. bake -> false
